 If a subclass of <PFObject> conforms to `PFSubclassing` and calls <registerSubclass>,
 Parse framework will be able to use that class as the native class for a Parse cloud object.

 Classes conforming to this protocol should subclass <PFObject> and
 include `PFObject+Subclass.h` in their implementation file.
 This ensures the methods in the Subclass category of <PFObject> are exposed in its subclasses only.
