*A new, faster ad blocker for Android, iOS, Opera, and Chrome*

Try Adblock Fast:

* [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rocketshipapps.adblockfast)
  (Android 5.0 and up with Samsung Internet 4.0 and up)
* [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/adblock-fast/id1032930802?at=1001lwfP) (iOS

* [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock-fast/nneejgmhfoecfeoffakdnolopppbbkfi)

Just as webpages grew bloated with ads, so too have ad blockers grown bloated
with little-used filtering rules and features that sap their speed and hog your
computer or device’s disk space, CPU cycles, and memory. Adblock Fast executes a
mere 7 optimized filtering rules to accelerate pages 8x more but consume 6x less
system resources than other ad blockers do.

Exactly how much faster, you ask, is Adblock Fast<em>?</em> Let’s crunch some
numbers.

### In Opera or Chrome

Adblock Fast installs a button in your browser’s toolbar. The button indicates
the status of the site and page you’re on:

![Blocked ads](opera/chrome/images/blocked-ads.png) Ads are being blocked on the
site and ads were found on the page.

![Blocked](opera/chrome/images/blocked.png) Ads are being blocked on the site,
but no ads were found on the page.

![Unblocked ads](opera/chrome/images/unblocked-ads.png) Ads aren’t being blocked
on the site, but ads were found on the page.

![Unblocked](opera/chrome/images/unblocked.png) Ads aren’t being blocked on the
site and no ads were found on the page.

If Adblock Fast is interfering with the behavior of the page, you can click the
button to unblock ads. Your choice will be remembered whenever you return to the
site.
